# University of Utah - Cybersecurity Bootcamp

This is where my projects for the University of Utah Cybersecurity Bootcamp will be uploaded.

First project is an Microsoft Azure based ELK Stack server running Filebeat and Metricbeat, with three VMs running behind a Jump Box Provisioner and a Load Balancer.
